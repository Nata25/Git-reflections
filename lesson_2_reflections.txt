What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

==============

     When I initialize a repository, git probably gets a command to begin tracking files 
     in the given directory. It must be some kind of preparation to further work. 

==============

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

==============

     Staging area can contain less files than the working directory. It is more 'targeted'
     set of files, prepared to be changed at the first place. These files are already 
     included in the repository, but need to be traced. By using staging area one can
     control changes better and make the later navigation through these changes easier
     to perform.
     
     UPD: [new explanation] 
     In staging area, there are only those files changes to which I want to commit.
     On committing, only changes to this file/these files will be committed.
     If I work simultaneously upon some other files but don't include them in staging area,
     git will not modify them on committing.
