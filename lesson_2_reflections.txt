What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

==============

     When I initialize a repository, git probably gets a command to begin tracking files 
     in the given directory. It must be some kind of preparation to further work. 

==============

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

==============

     In staging area, there are only those files changes to which I want to commit.
     On committing, only changes to this file/these files will be committed.
     If I work simultaneously upon some other files but don't include them in staging area,
     git will not modify them on committing.
