When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

=======

     It makes sense if I work or do a part of a work outdoors 
     (i.e., without direct access to my PC or notebook) and also
     if I'd like to share the results of my work with others 
     who can either simply use or contribute to this file.


=======

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

=======

     When I made some changes in local repository (Git), I might don't want GitHub to update
     to these changes automatically. This is because I don't want to make ANY changes 
     I made in my local host public.
     For example, I might decide to test this new functionality before let others to see it. 
     Or I just added some experimental functions which I want to compare to similar
     functions in parallel branch before deciding which of them I should keep.
     
     It seems that the same is with pulling changes out of remote repository to local host. 
     I might want to experiment with them before pulling into the master branch in Git.
     I also might want to have a feedback from my peers who work on a project online.
     So far, I cannot think about other reasons ;)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
     
========  

     Forks are created in remote repository to create one's own version of GitHub file.
     As GitHub doesn't have option of direct cloning from repository to repository, 
     that's where fork comes into help.
     A clone is a copy of repository which is being created in Git, i.e., on personal PC.
     Branch is a string of changes, usually unique changes. It's being created 'from the 
     root', with no content (unlike clone or fork, which include copied features from 
     the source) and then is filled with some new features.
