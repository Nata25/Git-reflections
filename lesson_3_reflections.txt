When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

=======

     It makes sense if I work or do a part of a work outdoors 
     (i.e., without direct access to my PC or notebook) and also
     if I'd like to share the results of my work with others 
     who can either simply use or contribute to this file.
